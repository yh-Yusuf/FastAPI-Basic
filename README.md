# FastAPI-Basic

Basic FastAPI app. Currently working on creating my custom API using FastAPI and PostGRE database. 

I will wrk the fundamentals of API design including routes, serialization/deserialization, schema validation, and models. I will also integrate SQL,  do testing with pytest, and work to build out a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions.
